<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am a self-employed student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computing at <a href="https://www.belgiumcampus.ac.za/">Belgium Campus iTversity</a>.</p>

<p>This website is exclusively built with HTML5, as I am just beginning my journey into web development. My goal is to become a full-stack developer by the end of 2024, mastering both front-end and back-end technologies.</p>

<p>In addition to web development, I have a deep passion for video games. This has inspired me to delve into game development using C#, which is the primary programming language taught at Belgium Campus. I am excited to combine my interests in technology and gaming to create innovative and engaging experiences.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to sharing my projects and progress with you!</p>
